# Decisions log (V2 « Maison » and V3 « Atelier »)

Built 2026-10-08. Every fact comes from the client's live site, https://www.cobaltcreation.com,
scraped the same day (`tools/scrape.py` -> `data/works.json`, `data/pages.json`).
Nothing was taken from V1 or invented.

## Source and inventory (re-verified 2026-10-08)
- Live inventory matched the brief: nav order and labels, 14 / 20 / 14 / 22 works (70),
  56 client logos (7 x 8), book PDF 9.7 MB, autoplay retail film, YouTube film `PG_bCMPUA3M`,
  12 people in 5 groups, footer address, phone, email and hours.
- Banner slides per page were read from the rendered slideshow (Wix only ships slide 1 in the HTML).
  Home: 3, Ateliers signatures: 2, Animations retail: 3, Atelier parisien: 3, Studio graphique: 3.
- The banner sources are wide panoramic crops (up to 10071 x 2146); some are only 1711 x 462.
  V2's taller banner (about 61 vh at 1440 x 900) therefore upscales those two by about 12 %.

## Copy
- Live text is used verbatim. Wix splits paragraphs into one line per `<p>`; lines were re-joined
  into paragraphs. Straight apostrophes became typographic ones (’). No words changed except:
  - « Dolce & Gabanna » -> « Dolce & Gabbana » (retail caption)
  - « La feuille l'or » -> « La feuille d'or » (Ateliers signatures)
  - « magnifie et créé des objets » -> « crée »
  - « Nos créatifs vous accompagne » -> « accompagnent »
  - « des cadeaux d'exceptions » -> « d'exception »
- Not changed, flagged for the client:
  - Juliette Leroux's address is published as `jderoux@cobaltcreation.com` (probably a typo for
    `jleroux@`, but unverifiable). Published exactly as live.
  - The privacy policy (copied verbatim, legal text) lists « 82, Avenue Niel - 75017 Paris »
    while every footer says « 35, Boulevard Berthier ». It also describes analytics data and cookies
    that the new static sites do not collect or set.
  - On the live contact page, the text « contact@cobaltcreation.com » links to `info@mysite.com`
    (a Wix placeholder). The new sites link it to contact@cobaltcreation.com, the address shown.
- Left out on purpose: the long keyword list under the Studio graphique gallery (Pégase, Ciel étoilé,
  GWP...). It is SEO filler with no sentence structure; showing it would hurt the page.
- The founding claim is the live one, « depuis plus de 10 ans ». V1 says « depuis 2014 » in its
  sharing description; that year appears nowhere on the live site.
- New interface words only (no facts): « Voir les réalisations », « Fermer », « Écrivez vos initiales »,
  « Afficher la carte », « Formulaire de contact », « L’équipe », « Réalisations », form messages.

## Media
- All photography is the client's own, downloaded at original resolution from Wix and re-encoded
  (AVIF + JPEG, 800/1600 px; banners up to 2560 px).
- The 56 logos were cut out of the live logo-wall image and recoloured in CSS (ink in V2, gold in V3).
- The retail film was re-encoded to 720 p, sound removed (it plays muted on the live site): 1.0 MB.
- No paid generation. V3's leather and gold-leaf textures are generated procedurally (`tools/textures.py`).
- Fonts: Jost, Geist, Bodoni Moda, all SIL Open Font License (licence files in `assets/fonts/`).
  The live site's Brandon Grotesque and Futura are licensed to Wix and were not copied.

## Behaviour
- No cookies, no analytics, no third-party request before a click: YouTube (`youtube-nocookie.com`)
  and Google Maps load only when the visitor asks. No cookie banner is therefore needed.
- The contact form has no server: it validates, then opens the visitor's mail app with the message
  addressed to contact@cobaltcreation.com, and says so under the button. Email and message are
  required (the live form only requires email; an empty mail would be useless).
- Pages keep the live slugs; canonical tags point to www.cobaltcreation.com; every page is
  `noindex, nofollow` and robots.txt disallows everything until launch.
- Light/dark: V2 is locked light and V3 locked dark, by brand choice rather than system setting.
- V3 hero transition (2026-10-08): scroll-linked, transforms and opacity only (the piece is trimmed by scaling its frame unevenly and its content back evenly, so nothing repaints). The pinned layout is chosen in the head so the first paint is final (no layout shift). With reduced motion, or without JS or `overflow: clip`, the hero stays static and the leather fades into the ink instead.
